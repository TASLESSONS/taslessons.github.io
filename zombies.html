<h1> Key Aims:</h1>
<p>The aim of this zombies escape game is to give the children direct feeling about what really matters among the parameters. 
In machine learning, the machanisms can be expressed with different formulas with the parameters. 
Different formulas work in different ways. Sometimes, people can feel the ways that formulas work. 
In this game, the features offset each other, then the extent of their influence matters. 
Alternatively, if precisely speaking, what really matters should be the sum of the products of features by their weights.</p>

<h1> Description:</h1>
<p><b>Can you escape the zombies?</b> was an adapted machine learning game. 
We intended to enable the children to understand features that lead to safety. 
We selected the "Zombie Escape" game from the Machine Learning for Kids project templates from <a href = "https://scratch.machinelearningforkids.co.uk/">Scratch</a> and adjusted a couple of feature values (simplifying lighting names and rounding up temperature values) to be children friendly. 
</p>
<p>The background story is that we are trapped in a huge hotel that has been overrun by zombies! 
We need to train our robot to learn the way the zombies behave, and what sort of places the zombies seem to like. 
There are 12 features for each room. Can we take the advice and work out which room does not have Zombies each time? Our mission is to escape the zombies. 
Attention to five of the features can make successful escapes over 90% of the time, which are lighting, brightness, humidity, temperature, and number of windows. 
When the favours of the features contradict, the number of features can offset each other. When the numbers of features equal, the extent of their influence matters. 
Alternatively, if precisely speaking, what really matters should be the sum of the products of features by their weights. This game gives people a direct feeling of how the machine learning formula works.
</p>
<p>We hoped the children can <b>take the points away</b> that machine learning has many predicting features and some of them are more important than others. 
However, because machines learn by themselves, sometimes they make mistakes that humans could not understand.
