<h1>Understanding Trustworthy Autonomous Systems for Young People</h1>
</header>

<div>
<p>This website reports a workshop that used co-production style technique for requirement elicitation from disabled young people at a very early stage of a trustworthy autonomous system. 
</p>
<p>
This workshop is believed to be practical and successful because (a) the format and structure of this workshop are designed gradually from simple to complex and contain a mixture of varied activities; (b) the activities were designed with gamification or entertainment and prepared with careful thoughts; (c) a lot of details in the activity designs and the overall organization reflect a heart that loves children from every member in the project team.
</p>
<p>
The workshop was attended by nine young people who have severe and complex needs, two school teachers from the Greenacre School and the Reimaging Trustworthy Autonomous System for Disable Young People project team.
</p>
<p>
A linked paper reported the process and organization of the workshop and made our suggestions to facilitate researchers to deliver such workshops to practice co-production more generally. This website provides the materials including activity worksheets, code, and building instructions online for the workshop.

<p>This website provides materials including activity worksheets, code, and building instructions for the workshop that was carried out on 7th December 2022 at the University of York Institute for Safe Autonomy, which we designed as a co-production workshop. The aim of this co-production workshop activity is to understand how we can engage young people within an autonomous systems design process in a very early
stage.</p>
<p>This workshop is believed to be practical and successful because (a) the
format and structure of this workshop are designed gradually from simple
to complex and contain a mixture of varied activities; (b) the activities
were designed with gamification or entertainment and prepared with careful
thoughts; (c) a lot of details in the activity designs and the overall organization reflect a heart that loves children from every member in the project
team.</p>
<p>The workshop was attended by nine disabled young people who have severe and complex needs, two school teachers from the Greenacre School and
the Reimaging Trustworthy Autonomous System for Disable Young People
project team.</p>
<p>We made our suggestions to facilitate researchers to deliver such workshops to practice co-production more generally in a paper "Understanding How We Can Engage Young
People with Autonomous Systems Designs: A Co-Production Activity Report".</p>
