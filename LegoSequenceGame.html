<h1>Guess the Sequence of the lego elements!</h1>
</header>

<div>
<h2>Machine learning techniques' design and application need strategies and tactics. The aim of this lego sequence game is for the children to look into the black box logically and figure out what is happening. 
To simplify the game, we provided a fixed number of elements, being four in total, and showed the children how to work out the sequence of the four elements happening for the first challenge, then encouraged the children to figure out the sequences in the rest of the challenges.
While gaining fun in the achievements after figuring out the sequences, we also enabled the children to focus their minds tactically only on the relevant information during the process.

<p><b>Guess the Sequence!</b> was a game built on a simple Lego robot that required the children to figure out the sequence of actions to solve the game. We intended to let the children to understand what was happening when looking inside the box. 
</p>
<p>We designed six Lego programs as six simple challenges on the robot. When each of the programs starts, a frog sound will play. When a wrong operation is performed, we will get a beep and a cross sign on the hub to represent a failure, and the robot will reset itself, so we need to start over from the beginning. Only when we perform the right operation in the right sequence until the end, we will get the celebration sound and a smiley face on the hub that represents a success. In each sequence, for every step that we do right, we can see the step number (1, 2, 3, 4) on the hub.
</p>
<p>At the beginning, we introduce what the four sensors are as a warming up. Then explain to the children that we have six challenges to overcome in that we need to find the sequences of the operations when the four sensors are used, once each. We will show the children how to unlock program 1 as an example, and it is better not to look at the solution, so the children know how to start over again if they guess wrong. Basically, they need to remember the steps (1 or 1-2-3…) that are correct and start over with them. After making sure that they all catch up with the understanding, we let the children unlock other programs and ask them “Can you work them out?”
</p>
<p>We will encourage them, prepare to show them the solution, and show our surprise when they work out a new challenge. We also show them the solution of a challenge in a fun way when there is silence stuck for more than one minute, so they can proceed to the next program.
</p>
<p>The <b>point to be taken</b> was that building a robot can be fun as long as you know what is happening in the box.
