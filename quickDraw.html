<h1>Does computers understand your pictures?</h1>
</header>

<div>
<h2>The aim of this quick draw game is to enable the children to think how machine learning such as neural network works. While they were competing with the timer when drawing their pictures, they had to draw the pictures in the ways that the computer recognises easier. Therefore, they would have to think how other people drew their pictures for the same objects. Then drawing became an activity that enables being recognised, rather than purely express their own thinking.

<p><b>Does the computer understand your pictures?</b> was a game that utilized neural network to recognize the children’s drawings. We used <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/"> Quick Draw website</a>. Our intention was to enable 
the children to understand how computers recognize images.
</p>
<p>At the beginning, we explained to the children that it was normal if the neural network can not recognize their drawings and it does not necessarily mean that their drawings are bad. They just need to draw an easy picture for the neural network to recognize each time. They can pause a few seconds and think about how to draw the picture before clicking the “Let’s Draw” button. Other children who were waiting were welcomed to give advice on how to draw, and we made them be aware that it is a game, not a test. When the children did not know the word to be drawn, we tell them or allow them to google. Discussions are also allowed and encouraged.</p>
<p>We wanted the children to <b>take a point away</b> that neural network might not know what they are drawing because it relies on data.</p>
