<h1>About us</h1>
</header>

<p>
	We report our work on this website about the workshop for eliciting requirements from some children that have severe and complex needs 
	that was carried out on 7th December 2022 at the Institute of Safery Autonomy (ISA) of the Computer Science Department of the University of York, UK. 
	This workshop is a part of the activities of the Reimagine Trustworthy Autonomous Systems for Young People project. 
	This project is funded by the UKRI Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) Hub under the Grant number: EP/V00784X/. 
	The team that designed and ran the workshop mainly were some members of the Assuring Autonomy International Programme (AAIP) who work in the ISA. 
	To introduce ourselves, we would like to show you the important websites below that are related to us.

The UKRI TAS Hub assembles a team from the Universities of Southampton, Nottingham and King’s College London. 
The Hub sits at the centre of the £33M <a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/new-trustworthy-autonomous-systems-projects-launched/">Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Programme</a>, funded by the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/our-main-funds/strategic-priorities-fund/">UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund</a>.
The role of the TAS Hub is to coordinate and work with six research nodes to establish a collaborative platform for the UK to enable the development of socially beneficial autonomous systems that are both <b>trustworthy in principle and trusted in practice</b> by individuals, society and government.

	Reimagining Trustworthy Autonomous Systems for Young People project promotes and practices the co-production style of requirement elicitation technique. 
	Co-production is a way of working together and doing social research. It involves traditional power dynamics and hierarchies within research being challenged in pursuit of equitable practices. 
	Co-production centres around key principles of equality, diversity, accessibility and shared gains. 
	According to Durose et al.[1], co-production in research aims to put principles of empowerment into practice, working together with communities and offering communities greater control over the research process. 
	Moreover, Liddiard et al.[2] believe that co-production became a necessary part of shaping inquiry at the very early stages.

	In 2016 a Lloyd’s Register Foundation Foresight Review of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) identified that the biggest obstacle to gaining the benefits of RAS was their assurance and regulation. 
The Assuring Autonomy International Programme (AAIP) is a £12m initiative funded by Lloyd’s Register Foundation and the University of York established to address these global challenges. 
AAIP works with an international community of developers, regulators, researchers and others to ensure the public can benefit from the safe, assured and regulated introduction and adoption of RAS.

The Institute for Safe Autonomy (ISA) provides a world-leading ecosystem for research and innovation, education, public engagement and commercial realisation.
Robotics, autonomous systems and AI have the potential to transform the way we live, travel and work – from driverless cars and remotely monitored ships to assistive robots at work, in the home and in hospitals.
ISA's mission is to ensure that robotics, their software, and their communications are safe.
ISA's research, housed in a dedicated new building with specialist laboratories and testing facilities, will find solutions to the global challenges in assuring the safety of robotics and connected autonomous systems.
