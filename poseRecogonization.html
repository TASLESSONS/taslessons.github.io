<h2>The aim of this game is to deepen the children's understanding about how machine learning works and how to improve the success rate. We designed a pose recognition game through Teachable Machine website to fulfil this in detail. 
Beginners tend to imagine the ways of how machine learning works and get surprised when they found something wrong. This game encouraged the children to find out the influencial factors and design their own projects later with more careful thoughts. 
For example, they realized that the computer performed better when their two poses were widely different. They also learnt to avoid noises in the data. We were happy to see that the children gained awareness of input data quality through this game.

<p><b>Can the computer see what you are doing?</b> was a machine learning project that recognizes poses. We used <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine website</a>. Our intention was to engage the children in the understanding of computer vision.
</p>
<p>There are two stages in this game. In stage one, this activity uses a
prepared pose project in Teachable Machine that takes two poses, sit still
and say hello. The children will play the prepared simple game with the two
poses in front of the camera. In stage two, when they get the understanding
of the poses being recognized automatically, and get excited with the idea
of new poses, we propose further experiments, and take them to the 
<a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/">Teachable Machine website</a>, create a new “Pose Project”, and let the children
play with the new trained model.</p>
<p>We wanted the children to <b>take the points away</b> that machine learning
can do classification according to their input data, for example, image, voice,
etc. To enable machine learning to work successfully, they need to provide
the right data, and train them properly.
